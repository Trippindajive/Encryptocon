# Encryptocon
A module for encrypting and decrypting messages for programs utilizing simple substitution ciphers. In particular, it is primarily developed for gameplay features, such as 'secret messages/codes'. Modularity is in mind as advanced cryptosystems become implemented (like Diffie-Hellman key exchange and RSA cryptosystem).
